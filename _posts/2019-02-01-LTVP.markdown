title:  "Applying for LTVP Three Years after Graduation: A Long Story"

### Background
I am an SM2 scholar who graduated with a chemistry degree in NTU. Like every lab rat oblivious to outside life, I was having a hard time looking for a job after graduation, to the extent that I fled back home and stayed largely unemployed for 3 years.

Long story short, I decided to return to Singapore after the long hiatus with the determination to get a job no matter what to discharge my Tuition Grant bond. By God's grace I was able to achieve my goal, get a visit pass and then a job. Thus I figure that I might share how it went to give my fellow expats some faith and insight into the process.

I did not apply for an LTVP at the point of my graduation, so it was the first time I approached ICA to apply for a visit pass. As far as I know, it is not possible to submit the application for LTVP overseas as you have to furnish your D/E card #. So I first asked my best friend who was alrealy a PR to apply for a Social Visit Pass (SVP) for me so that I could come to Singapore. The process was quick and easy. Just prepare your [Form 14A](https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/forms/form14a.pdf) with a 400*514 digital photo and send them over to your friend to fill the information into the online system. The result should be out in days.

### Return of Student Pass
This is quick and hassle-free. Walk into ICA and go to the 4th Floor, the student pass division. Use the ticketing machine at the door to get a queue number. Wait for 10 min to see an officer and hand over your STP.

Although the norm is to return your STP within 7 days of your graduation, I did not encounter any problem returning it 3 years later. That being said, just take a small trip to return it right after graduation to settle the mind.

### Application of LTVP
I was told to apply online using the [e-VP](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/evp) system. However, after I keyed in my information, the system threw an error __"The travel document details are not valid."__. Later I knew that it was because I had renewed my passport so the passport number had changed. I had to go to ICA to ask the staff to update my passport number manually.

I again went to Level 4 and queued up at the foreigner service counter. The queue can be insane at times, filled with sullen expats musing over their uncertain future. To save time, either go early, at 8:00 am, or go during lunchtime, when the traffic thins noticeably.

The receiptionist at the counter confirmed that the error was caused by my passport renewal. She updated my passport particulars and asked me to go to the e-service center at Level 1 to try again. Unfortunately, the error persisted. The receptionist then directed me to submit my application over the counter and gave me a [form 14](https://www.ica.gov.sg/cms/files/forms/Form14.pdf) to fill in. She also mentioned that I would need a sponsor letter from MOE to facilitate my application and therefore she would not give me a queue number unless I already had the letter in place.

Only after a month spent in back-and-forth correspondence with MoE did I manage to find out that the it was actually ICA's fault from the beginning. To clarify a few points:
1. For first-time LTVP applicant through the online system, a sponsor letter from MoE is not needed. The letter is only needed for over-the-counter physical application which we are not going to do.
2. The reason that the online system kept throwing error was that the receptionist did not update my passport particular correctly in the first place despite that I had asked her to double check if the info was indeed updated.
3. The officer at the counter, whom I had finally been allowed to see after presenting MoE's email saying that a sponsor letter was not needed, discovered the problem and updated the passport info again for me. This time it worked like a charm and I was able to proceed with online application.

I then filed the application online using one of the kiosks at the e-service center. It was fine to bring hardcopies of all relevant documents as they could be scanned with the machine and uploaded rightaway. When uploading the photo, I encountered a small problem that the scanned image exceeded 64kb which was the maximum file size allowed. Simply use the image editing tool accessable from the interface to cut and resave the image so that it is properly compressed.

A $30 processing fee was payable in the end. The fee could only be paid by NETS or credit cards, so having a visa card with sufficient fund came in handy. The total expense was $120 (or $150 if you also need to extend the SVP later) including another $90 of issurance fee payable after approval.

If your SVP is about to expire, you can apply for an extension online at the kiosk. __The sponsor does not have to be present nor is there any action required on his/her end.__ You can simply complete the application on your own - with another $30 processing fee.

Pro-tips: 
1. The application form for LTVP reuses a lot of information from form 14a, so if you have completed form 14a previously, bring it with you. 
2. Bring a phone with Internet access. When the receptionist tell you to retry the e-service, just try on the spot to see if the problem disappears. Save some queueing time if it doesn't work.


### In-principle Approval and Medical Check Up
I applied on Feb 14 and got the in-principal approval on Mar 1. I immediately booked an appointment for the collection of the pass. The nearest available date was 11 Mar.

The next step was the medical check-up consisting of
1. HIV test
2. Chest X-ray

For the medical test, I went to SATA CommHealth near Jurong East MRT Station. To go there, simply alight at the MRT station and exit via A to the bus interchange downstairs. Walk across the interchange and cross a road to see J-Cube, a shopping mall. The clinic is located in the building next to it with a fairprice on the ground level. Take a lift to go to level 4 to find the clinic.

The cost for the check up was $53.65. As a side note, you don't have to print out the medical form beforehand. Just download it and send it via email to the receptionist at the counter. She'll print it for you.

The HIV test was in the form of a blood draw. It sounded dreadful but was actually a breeze and you could feel nothing after 30 minutes. See [this page](https://healthunlocked.com/cllsupport/posts/132783026/care-tips-after-your-blood-test) for care tips after a blood draw. To summarize it in one sentence, apply undisturbed pressure to the needle site for 5-10 min with the arm elevated and remove the dressing strip 1 hour after.


### Collection of LTVP
It took about 1 hour to get your sparkling new LTVP. Hooray!

### Facilities around ICA
There is a **food court** outside the B exit of the Lavender MRT station. Alternatively, a cafe can be found at the first floor of ICA, together with **photo-taking booths**. For printing, you have to go to the **printing shops in the neighbourhood**. Please refer to [my guide on Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/484idruqves) as they can be very difficult to find without directions.

## Extra Cautions
### Proof of onward travel
For anyone __traveling one-way on a tourist visa__, it is a regulatory requirement for airline receptionists to ask for a proof of onward travel - a ticket leaving this country. In my case, my reason to stay long-term at Singapore was completely legit, but that alone was not enough to convince the receptionists to give me my air ticket - even though the customs officer at the destination country didn't bat an eye to let me through. 

Thus, it is essential for those __traveling one-way on a tourist visa__ to secure a leaving ticket in advance, or risk missing your flight / spending a lot more to get a return ticket on the spot.

Refer to [this article](https://expertvagabond.com/proof-of-onward-travel/) for economic ways to get a proof of onward travel. It is said that those flying to Singapore can get away by buying a bus ticket to Malaysia, which is very cheap (around $30).
