We've all had that experience of reading some description of early symptoms of a grave disease and finding it eerily coincident with our minor discomfort. Lately, I have been worrying about my increased consumption of pastries. By Googling I stumbled upon an article about diabete warning signs that lists some dreadfully familiar criteria:

> * Increased thirst
> * Increased hunger (especially after eating)
> * Dry mouth
> * Frequent urination or urine infections
> * Unexplained weight loss (even though you are eating and feel hungry)
> * Fatigue (weak, tired feeling)
> * Blurred vision
> * Headaches

-- [_Diabetes Warning Signs_, WebMD.com](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/diabetes-warning-signs) 

I do more or less experience these symptoms except for weight loss (I am having quite the opposite!). It struck a bell in me that I need to watch my diet more carefully in this decandence-filled modern city of Singapore. That being said, the toil of counting calories is often daunting even for a seasoned veteran of body building. Luckily, we don't have to be super accurate in our guestimation. In order to gauge daily calory intake efficiently, I've devised a system to categorize different dishes roughly by their calories, and then use these Tetris blocks of different sizes to plan my daily intake. This makes the diet guidelines simpler to memorize and easier to add new dishes.

### Categories of Food Based on Calories per Serving
I constantly dine out so the list mainly consists of prepared hawker food. The nutritional values of hawker dishes are taken from [Innovatice Diagnostics' calorie chart of Singaporean Food](http://www.innovativelab.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IDPL-FOOD-CALORIE-CHART-1.pdf) and the fast food from the the vendor's websites.

Food is categorized to four types with increasing amount of energy per serving:

Snacks (150-250 kcal):
1. 2 apples
2. 2 bananas
3. 1 cookie
4. Salted nuts x 10-15

Light meal (350 kcal):
1. Fishball Noodles
2. Yong Tau Fu
3. Subway breakfast sandwiches
4. Plain waffle

Normal meal (550 kcal):
1. Cai Png (2 veg 1 rice)
2. Nasi Lemak
3. Mee Siam
4. Prawn noodles (soup)
6. Subway subs

Hearty meal (750 kcal):
1. Fried Kway Teow
2. Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee
3. Chicken Rice
4. Chicken Briyani
5. Whole package of nuts (140g)


### Daily Plans
We can use the categories as building blocks to construct daily diet plans that contain the desired number of calories. Use [this calculator](https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html) to get your necessary daily calorie intake. My goal is to eat 1500 kcal/day. 

**Plan 1 - no breakfast/supper:**

|Snacks|Light Meal|Normal Meal|Hearty Meal
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
|3|1|1|0
|2|0|2|0
|2|1|0|1
|1|0|1|1

Skipping breakfast isn't as harmful as we perceive. Actually, [Intermittant fasting](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/intermittent-fasting-guide#methods) encourages dropping breakfast to increase the body's metabolic rate thus making the fat burn faster.

**Plan 2 - three meals:**

|Snacks|Light Meal|Normal Meal|Hearty Meal
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
|3|3|0|0
|1|2|1|0
|0|1|2|0
|0|2|0|1

You will find that by tweaking the portion of meals and number of snacks, we can build a large variety of plans suitable for every lifestyle. 

**As a sidenote, I'd like to introduce my Holy Grail diet food: cherry tomatoes at 40kcal/160g!!!** Eat as many as you like, whenever you have exceeded the daily calorie quota but still feel hungry.

### Substitution
Once you choose a plan, simply substitute the placeholders with food in that category. Here are some examples.

**Diet 1 - Morning Rush**

|Category|Food|Calories
|:-:|:-:|:-:
|Snacks|2 apples | 170
|Snacks|nuts x10 | 150
|Normal Meal|cai png/Mee Siam | 550
|Light Meal|noodles | 350
|Snacks|2 bananas | 180
|Total||1500

**Diet 2 - Balanced Meals**

|Category|Food|Calories
|:-:|:-:|:-:
|Snacks|1 Subway cookie | 220
|Light Meal|1 Subway sandwiches | 400
|Normal Meal|cai png/oily noodles | 550
|Light Meal|noodles | 350
|Total|| 1520


**Diet 3 - Sweet Indulgence**

|Category|Food|Calories
|:-:|:-:|:-:
|Normal Meal|cheesecake|500
|Normal Meal|cai png|550
|Light Meal|noodles|350
|Snacks| 1 apple|80
|Total||1480

I find that this method not only helps me regulate food consumption, it also makes me guilt-free when enjoying sweet treats by planning out beforehand. Now I have a good idea of how much calories there are in some sinful delights, I can gauge what is the "price" to pay if I want to enjoy one of them - skipping either a meal or several snacks from my daily plan.
