My name is Liu Yang. I graduated from NTU with a Bsc. in chemistry. This blog serves to document the questions and answers I've found during my study, work and life, centered on chemistry and life as an expat in Singapore.

I am currently looking for a job in Singapore. Please refer to my CV here (pdf format). I can be reached by email: yliu9055@gmail.com, or drop me a call at +65-81788856.
